It's because the epidemic occurring worldwide that people can't get in touch with each other in the flesh and many activities are greatly affected even cancelled. This year's *Mid-Autumn Festival* holds the game '*Bobing*' as usual. And only goes online can it be hold as expected. So here is going to develop an online '*Bobing*' game for Chinese people and friends over the world. 

### Approach

First, we need a software for us to design a prototype of it. So we choose Modao to bulid the interface of the Bobing game. After we made a satisfing version, we will code for this prototype and achieve various functions. After all the main work are done, we will make some adjustments to our UI to make it more beautiful.

### Benefit
