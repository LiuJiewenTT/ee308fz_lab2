## Keys or Difficulties in programming thinking

[Top](#Contents)

1. Problem: Hide the default actionbar so we can make it a better look.
   Solution: After carefully inspecting codes of some samples, we set it to some theme to solve it.
2. Problem: Make a customized kind of actionbar and make sure it's good for reusing.
   Solution: Tried multiple combinations of settings, we finally found the way the achieve this. This process cost us lots of time.
3. Problem: How to think about the relationship between single player mode and multiplayer mode.
   Solution: We made thorough understanding of class Activity and decided to share the same activity but invoked differently.
4. Key: Speed up working progress if simple and plain solutions exist.
5. Key: Make good uses of debug function of the IDE to figure out mistakes quickly.
